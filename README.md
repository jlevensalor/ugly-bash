# ugly-bash
Really quick and ugly way to save time setting up a terraform and packer on Linux or Mac....if it's windows who cares. 

This will put the files /opt/local/<package>/version/
You will need to run this as sudo though 

###For example: 
``` 
$ sudo bash setup-terraform-packer-mac-linux.sh 
``` 
###If you want to see details 

``` 
$ sudo bash -x setup-terraform-packer-mac-linux.sh
```
